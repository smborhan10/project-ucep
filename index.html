                <h1>M. R. Siddiqi, the first Chairperson</h1>
                <p>Mr. M. R. Siddiqi was elected as the first Chairperson of UCEP Bangladesh after the sudden demise of its founder Mr. Lindsay Allan Cheyne. He delivered his responsibilities as UCEP Bangladesh Chairperson for a little more than 2 years from May, 1988 to October 1990. It should be noted that he himself paid for the expenses of UCEP Bangladesh for the first two months.
                    Mr. Siddiqi was widely renowned as a politician, Member of Parliament, reputed industrialist and former ambassador and chartered accountant. In 1972, he was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Foreign Trade in the Cabinet of the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.</p>
